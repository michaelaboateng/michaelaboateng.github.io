From the earliest days of my childhood, I, Michaela Boateng, dreamed of wearing the white coat, with a stethoscope wrapped around my neck, caring for patients with dedication. This vision prompted me to embark on a pre-medical journey during my undergraduate years. But as I delved deeper into the coursework, a realization settled in: while the world of medicine was noble and profound, it wasn't where my heart truly belonged.

As I pondered my path, memories of my younger days resurfaced. Memories of hours spent crafting digital spaces on WebPress, building not just websites but also a foundation for a passion I didn't fully understand at the time. Those weren't merely childhood pastimes; they were early signs of a passion that had lain dormant.

Acknowledging this revelation, I transitioned my focus from medicine to the realm of web development. This wasn't a move away from a dream, but rather a return to a genuine love. Now, I channel the skills I nurtured on WebPress during my younger days, refining and adapting them to the nuances of today's web world. My journey into web development isn't a detour but a full-circle moment â€” a heartfelt homecoming.
